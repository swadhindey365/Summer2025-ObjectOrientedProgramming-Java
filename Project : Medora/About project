🏥 Hospital Information & Management System
This Java OOP + JavaFX-based project is a Hospital Information & Management System designed to bridge the gap between the public, hospitals, and administrative verification. It enables users to find verified hospitals in their district, allows hospitals to register and update bed/contact information, and provides an admin panel for verifying or rejecting hospital requests.
